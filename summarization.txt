A Decision Tree is a simple representation for classifying examples. 
It is a Supervised Machine Learning where 
the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter.
There are two main types of Decision Trees:
Classification Trees and Regression Trees.
Decision trees are built using a heuristic called recursive partitioning. 
The key idea is to use a decision tree to partition
the data space into cluster (or dense) regions and empty (or sparse) regions. 
This approach is also commonly known as divide and conquer because it splits the data into subsets, 
which are then split repeatedly into even smaller subsets. 
Decision Trees follow Divide-and-Conquer Algorithm. 
Extremely fast at classifying unknown records. 
Easy to interpret for small-sized trees. 
Accuracy comparable to other classification techniques for simple data sets. 
Disadvantages: Easy to overfit and difficult to interpret.
Biomedical Engineering (decision trees for identifying features to be used in implantable devices). 
Astronomy (classify galaxies).
